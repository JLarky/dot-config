SublimeGit 1.0.26
=================

Bug Fixes:
----------
 - Try to fix memory leak regarding git_commit_pedantic. This involves:
     1. Turning it off by default.
     2. Making sure that only git commit buffers are affected.
     3. Making sure that the EventListener does as little work as possible.
    (Issue #76)


Documentation
-------------
 - Corrected examples in documentation for git_merge_flags. (Issue #77)
