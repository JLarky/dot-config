SublimeGit 1.0.21
=================

Enhancements:
-------------
 - Makes the status bar completely async on both ST2 and ST3. This should
   improve performance significantly when switching files.

 - Adds a setting for the path to gitk.


Bug Fixes:
----------
 - Focus on the existing diff view (if any) when using the diff command or
   pressing d in the status view.

 - Do not show ANSI escape codes in diff lines when pulling and merging
   from a remote.
