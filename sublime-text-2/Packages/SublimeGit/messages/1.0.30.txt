SublimeGit 1.0.30
=================


Bug Fixes:
----------
 - Fixes issue with missing binary in the async status line updater.
   (Issues #32 and #33)

 - Adds setting for fallback encodings, which should alleviate some
   of the issues with using non-UTF-8 files. (Issues #32 and #53)

 - Improves updating of diff view to scroll less when auto-updating
   the diff. (Issue #114)

 - Adds error message dialog to git custom command. (Issue #115)

 - Force update of git index before running the status bar updater
   to make sure repository isn't shown as dirty just because a file
   has been saved. (Issue #106)
